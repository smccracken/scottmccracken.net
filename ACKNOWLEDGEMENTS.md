One of the beatiful things about the web is learning from others who have authored or shared smart solutions that make building websites a little bit nicer.

## Inspiration & References

- **Setting up Biome with Astro** – [Astro Tips](https://astro-tips.dev/tips/biome/), [Eva Decker](https://github.com/evadecker/eva.town/blob/main/biome.jsonc), and [Princesseuh](https://github.com/withastro/language-tools/blob/main/biome.json) all have good starting points for Biome + Astro. I'm hoping Astro support continues to evolve because [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) is ⚡ _fast_ ⚡.
- **Layouts and compositions** – [Every Layout](https://every-layout.dev/) is Heydon Pickering & Andy Bell's thorough resource for generating some of the most robust and useful layout compositions in CSS. I use them extensively.
- **Fluid Type and Spacing** – Utopia's immensely helpful [fluid type](https://utopia.fyi/type/calculator/?c=320,8,1.2,1440,12,1.333,6,2,&s=0.75%7C0.5,1.5%7C2%7C3%7C4%7C6,s-l&g=s,l,xl,NaN) and [fluid space](https://utopia.fyi/space/calculator?c=320,8,1.2,1440,12,1.333,6,2,&s=0.75%7C0.5,1.5%7C2%7C3%7C4%7C6,s-l&g=s,l,xl,NaN) calculators which contain far more math than I'm capable of mathing.
- **Theme Toggle** –  Adam Argyle's [building a theme switch component](https://web.dev/articles/building/a-theme-switch-component) is a deeply comprehensive and fun to follow tutortial.
- **CSS Utilities** – Andy Bell has a treasure trove of useful CSS utilities but the crown jewel is the [Flow CSS Utility](https://piccalil.li/blog/flow-utility/) which is a must have in each of my projects now.
