One of the beatiful things about the web is learning from others who have authored or shared smart solutions that make building websites a little bit nicer.

## Inspiration & References

- **Theme Toggle** – I learned so much on [building a theme switch component](https://web.dev/articles/building/a-theme-switch-component) from Adam Argyle. His tutorial is deeply thoughtful, comprehensive, and fun to follow.
- **CSS Utilities** – Andy Bell has a treasure trove of useful CSS utilities but the crown jewel is the [Flow CSS Utility](https://piccalil.li/blog/flow-utility/) which is a must have in each of my projects now.
