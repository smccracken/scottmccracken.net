I believe in the core foundations of the web. That means writing semantic HTML, progressively enhanced CSS, and presentational JavaScript to build accessible web user interfaces. 

My goal with any new site I build is meet the following criteria:

+ **Accessible by default** with semantic markup that can be logically followed by keyboard users and read by screen readers.
+ **Optimized for mobile devices** first, but responsive enough to work on almost any other screen.
+ **Progressively enhanced** with modern CSS built-upon appropriate&#8212;but not pixel perfect&#8212;fallbacks for older browsers. Additionally Javascript can be used to add interactivity, but I'll make every effort to make sure it's not _required_ for a functional site. 
+ **Eliminate as much cruft as possible** to make sure the site loads on any connection.
